<p> I am an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=307487&org=DMS&from=home">NSF Postdoctoral Fellow</a> and a Simons Instructor (research postdoc) at <a href="https://math.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>. </p>

<p> Previously, I was a graduate student in mathematics at <a href="https://www.math.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>, advised by <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/">Curt McMullen</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate student in math and computer science at the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/">University of Michigan</a>. </p>

<p> My main research interests include group actions and foliations on moduli spaces, mapping class groups, and dynamics of billiards and interval exchanges. </p>

<h2> Papers and preprints: </h2>

<p> <b> (1) </b> Dynamics of the absolute period foliation of a stratum of holomorphic 1-forms (2021), <a href="ErgodicityDensityConnectivity_052224.pdf">preprint</a> </p>

<p> We establish the ergodicity of the absolute period foliation of the area-1 locus of most stratum components of holomorphic 1-forms, and we give explicit full measure sets of dense leaves. We obtain similar results for subspaces of stratum components defined by constraints on the absolute periods. We also address the question of when two isoperiodic 1-forms in a stratum component can be connected by a path in the stratum along which the absolute periods are constant. Our dynamical results are a consequence of a classification of stratum components in which a typical space of isoperiodic forms is connected. </p>

<p> <b> (2) </b> Dense real Rel flow orbits and absolute period leaves (2022), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04628">preprint</a> </p>

<p> We show the existence of a dense orbit for real Rel flows on the area-1 locus of every connected component of every stratum of holomorphic 1-forms with at least 2 distinct zeros. For this purpose, we establish a general density criterion for SL(2,R)-orbit closures, based on finding an orbit of a real Rel flow whose closure contains a horocycle. This criterion can be verified using explicit constructions of holomorphic 1-forms with a periodic horizontal foliation. Our constructions also provide explicit examples of dense leaves of the absolute period foliation and many subfoliations of these loci. </p>

<p> <b> (3) </b> Saturated orbit closures in the Hodge bundle (2022), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08795">preprint</a> </p>

<p> We give a new proof of the classification of GL(2,R)-orbit closures that are saturated for the absolute period foliation of the Hodge bundle. As a consequence, we obtain a short proof of the classification of closures of leaves of the absolute period foliation of the Hodge bundle. Our approach is based on a method for classifying GL(2,R)-orbit closures using deformations of flat pairs of pants. </p>

<p> <b> (4) </b> Uniqueness of the Veech 14-gon (2022), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09702">preprint</a>, Sage code forthcoming </p>

<p> We show that the Veech 14-gon generates the unique algebraically primitive Teichmüller curve in its stratum component. </p>

<p> <b> (5) </b> Complex relative period geodesics in moduli space, in preparation. </p>

<p> We classify the closures of leaves of the absolute period foliation of most strata, outside a proper algebraic subvariety, and in many cases we obtain a complete classification of closures of leaves.
